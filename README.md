### Install
- Verify that obsidian path is correct in the source code.
- Compile the code.

```bash
gcc obsgit.c -o obsgit
sudo mv obsgit /usr/local/bin
```
### isinc
- This is a bash script to run a specific command that is too long to type every time I use it.
```bash
sudo mv isinc /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/isinc
```
